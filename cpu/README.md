CPU Scheduler Program - Readme File
@author: Kerri McMahon

Welcome to my CPU Scheduling Simulation Program. Some brief things to note:

-- ASSUMPTIONS --
Maximum amount of process that can be considered is 10 for each algorithm.

- In Round Robin Algorithm, I have incorporated consideration for the arrival times
into the program. I was not sure if this was required, so I did it however there is
also an option to initialize all arrival times to 0.



-- PURPOSE --
My program consists of:

int main() function
Purpose: to control program flow

void fcfs() function
Purpose: to perform First Come First Serve Algorithm

void sjf() function
Purpose: to perform Shortest Job First Algorithm

void rr() function
Purpose: to perform Round Robin Algorithm

My program does NOT include a header file, as it was not necessary.
